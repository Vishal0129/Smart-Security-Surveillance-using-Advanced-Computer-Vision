# Smart Security Surveillance using Advanced Computer Vision

## Security Surviellance System using AI ( Hacktopia-2k23 )


## Project Description

- This project is a security surviellance system which uses AI to detect the presence of a criminal in the camera footage and alert the authorities.

- The system uses a camera to capture the footage and then uses a trained model to detect the presence of a criminal in the footage.

- The system then notifies the website where the footage is being streamed and authorities can watch the footage and take necessary actions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
    - OpenCV
    - Dlib
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
